# Personal latex templates

This a collection of files that can be copied to a directory for a new latex document.
For technical documents like scientific articles and notes, use `article`.
For slides with the beamer package and the Metropolis theme, use `slides`.
For the Inkscape latex extension, set Inkscape to use the file in `inkscape`.
The `create_bib.sh` script can can tex files and create a bib file for all references.
It assumes the python package bibtools is installed, and that the bib files are located in ~/refs/bibs/.

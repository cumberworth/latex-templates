\opening{To Whom It May Concern:}

I am a Canadian citizen residing and working in the Netherlands. The organization I work for, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), was recently hacked and personal data leaked, some of which as already been sold on the dark web. On their servers was a copy of my passport. I have been advised to renew my passport as soon as possible. I have included a document sent from NWO that was sent to me describing the situation.

It is for this reason that I am applying to renew my passport while it has more than a year validity.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
